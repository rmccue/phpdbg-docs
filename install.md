# Installation

phpdbg is maintained as an official part of PHP, but is typically not installed by default. You can install it via your package manager, similar to `php-cgi` and `php-fpm`.

## Ubuntu

If you're using [`ppa:ondrej/php`](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php), the package is available as `php-phpdbg`:

```
sudo apt-get install php-phpdbg
```
